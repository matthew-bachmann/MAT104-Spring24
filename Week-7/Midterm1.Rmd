### Instructions

+ This is the take home midterm due on Saturday, March 2nd, at 9:00 pm.

+ There are 25 possible points on this assignment.

+ This midterm should take you 2-3 hours to complete. Do NOT exceed 6 hours of working on the exam. You may work on the exam at various points between now and the due date but the total time cannot exceed 6 hours. 

+ **Rules:**

  - You are allowed to use any course materials on this midterm. This includes the course texts, previous worksheets, and previous labs.

  - You should not be using google or any other website at any point during this exam. 
  - If you are having trouble using `R` (graphing, for example), look through old worksheets and labs for example code. You will not be asked to do anything in `R` that you have not done before. 
  - You are not permitted to speak with any one other than me about the midterm till after the due date. (Even if you finish early, don't talk to your class mates about it since they might not be finished).
  - Please attempt the exam early so that we can fix any knitting issues before the due date. Your midterm will not be accepted if it does not knit.

+ Answer `R` questions by writing code where you are asked to `## insert code here`
+ Answer written questions in the space provided where it says "Write your answer here".
+ All answers have a code chunk section but you may not always need to use the code chunks. 
+ **Written answers need to be in complete sentences.**
+ **You need to show your work or `R` code for any calculations.**

##### **Exercise 13. I always go to Summit coffee shop to perform one of three activities: $50 \%$ of my visits are to grade for this class, $40 \%$ of the visits I will read a novel, and $10 \%$ of the visits I will play chess. Since Davidson is a small town, I will often be interrupted by someone I know. If I am grading, there is a $75 \%$ chance someone will interrupt me. If I am reading a novel, there is only a $10 \%$ chance someone will interrupt me. Below is a tree diagram representing the events with various missing values. Answer the questions below about the tree diagram: (show all work) (3 points)**
