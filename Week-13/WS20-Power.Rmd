## Decision Errors


| |$H_0$ is True | $H_0$ is False |
|:--|:--|:--|
|Do not reject $H_0$ | Correct conclusion | Type II error
|Reject $H_0$ | Type I error | Correct conclusion |

  
## Power

To illustrate what we mean by **power**, we will look at an example
  
#### **Example:** The researchers would like to run the clinical trial on patients with systolic blood pressures between $140$ and $180$ mmHg. Suppose previously published studies suggest that the standard deviation of the patientsâ€™ blood pressures will be about $12$ mmHg and the distribution of patient blood pressures will be approximately normal. Out of $200$ patients, $100$ are given a new medication meant to reduce blood pressure and the other $100$ are given the standard treatment. Set up hypotheses to determine if the medicine reduces the average blood pressure of the group taking the new medication. 

$H_0: \mu_{new} - \mu_{old} \geq 0$

$H_A: \mu_{new} - \mu_{old} < 0$





1. If there truly is a $3$ mmHg reduction but we fail to reject the null hypothesis, what type of an error is this?

Draw a picture with two potential sampling distributions: the sampling distribution where we assume the null hypothesis is true and the the sampling distribution where we assume the effect of $3$ mmHg reduction is true. Label the area that represents the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis assuming it is wrong.

2. Find the power of the test at detecting a $3$ mmHg reduction in blood pressure. (This is one minus the shaded area above)

3. Suppose we do a random sample of $15$ values from a normally distributed population where $\sigma =6$ and $\mu$ is unknown. We want to perform a hypothesis test using a significance level $\alpha = .05$ where the hypotheses are given below. What is the power of the test at detecting a mean of $54$? Include a picture with two potential sampling distributions: the sampling distribution where we assume the null hypothesis is true and the the sampling distribution where we assume the true mean is $54$ and shade the region representing the power. 

$H_0: \mu = 50$

$H_A: \mu > 50$

4. Suppose we do a random sample of $42$ values from a normally distributed population where $\sigma =16$ and $\mu$ is unknown. We want to perform a hypothesis test using a significance level $\alpha = .10$ where the hypotheses are given below. What is the power of the test at detecting a mean of $275$? Include a picture with two potential sampling distributions: the sampling distribution where we assume the null hypothesis is true and the the sampling distribution where we assume the true mean is $275$ and shade the region representing the power. 

$H_0: \mu = 300$

$H_A: \mu < 300$

5. Suppose that we randomly sample scores on a test from two groups; $315$ observations from group $A$ and $225$ observations from group $B$. Group $A$ has population standard deviation $32$ and group $B$ has population standard deviation $25$. We want to perform a hypothesis test using a significance level $\alpha = .10$ where the hypotheses are given below. What is the power of the test at detecting a group $A$ having an average of $20$ higher than group $B$ ? Include a picture with two potential sampling distributions: the sampling distribution where we assume the null hypothesis is true and the the sampling distribution where we assume the group $A$ scores $20$ points higher and shade the region representing the power.

$H_0: \mu_A - \mu_B \leq 0$

$H_A: \mu_A - \mu_B > 0$
