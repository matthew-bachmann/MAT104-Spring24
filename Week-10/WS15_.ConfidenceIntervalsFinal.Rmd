## Central Limit Theorem

### Review from lab

+ Taking a sample of size $n$ and finding the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is a repeatable process
+ Therefore, $\bar{X}$ is a random variable with a probability distribution called the sampling distribution.

The **central limit theorem** (for sample means) says that as the sample size $n$ increases, the sampling distribution for the sample mean approaches a **normal distribution**:

$$ \bar{X} \sim N \left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$$

+ This means that the **sampling distribution** is centered at the population mean $\mu$ and has standard deviation equal to $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ (the standard error of the mean).

+ We won't prove this fact, but you have done several experiments in `R` that provide empirical evidence for the theorem.

## Including Pictures

1. Include a picture of the sampling distribution below:

<div>

</center>
:::
</div>

+ about $68 \%$ of sample means are within one standard error of the population mean

+ about $ 68 \%$ of sample means are inside the range:

$$ \mu - (1*SE) \leq \bar{X} \leq \mu + (1*SE) $$

+ the probability that a sample mean is within a certain range is call the **confidence level**. 
+ the above range corresponds to a confidence level of about $68 \%$.
+ $alpha$ corresponds to the probability that a sample mean IS NOT within the range.
+ the above range corresponds to an $\alpha$ of about $32 \%$

+ We keep saying **about** $68 \%$ because this is just an estimate of the percentage within one standard deviation. 
+ If you want a confidence level of **exactly** $68\%$ you need to know the **exact** $z$-scores.
+ these are called **critical z-scores** and are denoted by $z_{\alpha / 2 }$
+ It is the absolute value 
+ Below is a picture for the situation:

2. Find the exact $z$-scores corresponding to a confidence level of $68 \%$.

```{r}

```


### Example 

For a confidence level of $75 \%$:

+ $\alpha = 25 \%$.

+ Below is picture of the sampling distribution for a confidence level of $75 \%$:

## Rearranging







3. Draw a picture that represents the sampling distribution for the sample mean with a $90 %$ confidence level.

4. What is $\alpha$ for a $90 \% confidence level?

5. What is the exact $z$-score needed for a $90 \%$ confidence level?

```{r}

```

6. Express a range of values such that there is a $90 \%$ probability the sample mean will land in that range.
