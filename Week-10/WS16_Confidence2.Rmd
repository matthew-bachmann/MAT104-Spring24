## Review from last class

Since the central limit theorem says that as we increase the sample size $n$ the sampling distribution for the sample mean is:

$$ \bar{X} \sim N(\mu, SE) $$

where the standard error is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. We can use this to find a confidence level for sample means.

The range of values such that a random sample of size $n$ with sample mean $\bar{X}$ is within this range $P \%$ of the time is given by:

$$ \mu - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot SE \leq \bar{X} \leq \mu + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot SE$$

where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical $Z$-score corresponding to the desired percentage $P \%$.

#### Example 

Suppose a population has mean $15$ and standard deviation $2.5$. Find a range of values such that a random sample of $100$ observations will fall within the range with a $95 \%$ probability.

# Step 1: Write down the known quantities

# Step 2: Draw a picture of the sampling distribution, title the graph N(\mu,SE)

# Step 3: Find the critical Z-scores

# Step 4: Calculate the interval 

# Step 5: Write your conclusion in a complete sentence

```

## Confidence Interval


$$ \mu - z_{\alpha/2} \cdot SE \leq \bar{X} \leq \mu + z_{\alpha/2} \cdot SE$$

 

#### Example

Suppose that an unknown population has standard deviation $\sigma = 34$. A sample of $450$ observations has a sample mean $\bar{X}= 62$. Find a $95 \%$ confidence interval.

```{r}
# Step 1: Write down the known quantities

# Step 2: Find the critical $Z$-scores

# Step 3: Calculate the interval

# Step 4: Write your conclusion in a complete sentence

```

## Interpreting confidence intervals

In the last example we found that "we are $95 \%$ confident that the true population mean is between $58.859$ to $65.14$. 




1. What are the critical $Z$-scores corresponding to a confidence level of $70 \%$. 

```{r}

```

2. Suppose average pizza delivery times are normally distributed with an unknown population mean and a population standard deviation of six minutes. A random sample of $28$ pizza delivery restaurants is taken and has a sample mean delivery time of $36$ minutes. Find a $90 \%$ confidence interval for the population mean delivery time (use the steps from the example).

```{r}
# Step 1: Write down the known quantities

# Step 2: Find the critical $Z$-scores

# Step 3: Calculate the interval

# Step 4: Write your conclusion in a complete sentence

```




3. From a population with population mean $16$ and standard deviation $2$ a sample of $35$ observations is taken. Provide an interval such that there is an $80 \%$ chance that the sample mean falls within the range.

```{r}
# Step 1: Write down the known quantities

# Step 2: Draw a picture of the sampling distribution, title the graph N(\mu,SE)

# Step 3: Find the critical Z-scores

# Step 4: Calculate the interval 

# Step 5: Write your conclusion in a complete sentence

```




4. Suppose scores on exams in statistics are normally distributed with an unknown population mean and a population standard deviation of $3$ points. A random sample of $36$ scores is taken with an mean score of $72$. Find a $98 \%$ confidence interval for the mean exam score of the population.

```{r}
# Step 1: Write down the known quantities

# Step 2: Find the critical $Z$-scores

# Step 3: Calculate the interval

# Step 4: Write your conclusion in a complete sentence

```
