## Central Limit Theorem

### Review from lab



$$ \bar{X} \sim N \left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$$


## Including Pictures

1. Include a picture of the sampling distribution below:

<div>
:::{#answer}

<center>
<img src="./place_holder.JPG" width="650"/>
</center>

:::
</div>


2. Find the exact $z$-scores corresponding to a confidence level of $68 \%$.

```{r}

```


### Example 

Below is the situation for a $75 \% confidence level:




3. Draw a picture that represents the sampling distribution for the sample mean with a $90 %$ confidence level.

<div>
:::{#answer}


:::
</div>

4. What is $\alpha$ for a $90 \% confidence level?

<div>
:::{#answer}


:::
</div>

5. What is the exact $z$-score needed for a $90 \%$ confidence level?

```{r}

```

6. Express a range of values such that there is a $90 \%$ probability the sample mean will land in that range.

<div>
:::{#answer}


:::
</div>
