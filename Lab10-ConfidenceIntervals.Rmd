## Conditions for Proportions

---

We saw that with for **sample means** we need:

+ **independence** 
+ **normality**

in order to use central limit theorem methods.

---

For **population proportions** we need: 

+ **independence**
+ **success-failure**

in order to use central limit theorem methods. Independence is the same as for sample means (observations need to come from simple random samples). Success-failure is different, it requires that:

+ $p \cdot n \geq 10$
+ $(1-p) \cdot n \geq 10$

This means that the there can't be an extremely uneven number of successes and failures. For example, suppose we want to know the proportion of the population that enjoys anchovies so we randomly sample $100$ people. Only $7$ people say they like anchovies and $93$ say that they don't. Then the proportion of successes is $7/100$ and the proportion of failures is $93/100$ and:

+ $p \cdot n = 7/100 \cdot 100 = 7$
+ $(1-p) \cdot n = 93/100 \cdot 100 = 93$

Since $p \cdot n <10$ we cannot use the central limit theorem for population proportions. This proportion does not meet the success-failure condition.

#### **Problem:** Administrators suggest that the majority of students support their new uniform policy. A skeptical student polls her school using simple random sampling to determine whether students in the school district are for or against the new legislation regarding school uniforms. She surveys $600$ students and finds that $480$ are against the new legislation.

#### **Problem:** Political experts claim that only $35 \%$ of registered voters vote in local elections. A recent political poll (assume they use polling methods that ensure independence) asks $10000$ registered voters if they plan to vote in their next local election. The poll finds that $840$ registered voters will vote in the next local election.

## Practice with Means

#### **Problem:** In a small city renowned for its music school the average number of years a student takes piano lessons is normally distributed. A local reporter claims the average child takes about $7$ years of piano lessons. To test this claim we take a random sample of $20$ children from the city, with a mean of $4.6$ years of piano lessons and a standard deviation of $2.2$ years. Answer the following:

## Comparing population proportions

We often want to compare the proportion from two different populations. Here our goal isn't to find the the true population proportion for either of the populations, but rather to find how **different** the population proportions are.

So, the statistic we care about is:

$$ p_1 - p_2$$

the difference between the population proportion for one population and the population proportion for a second population.

The central limit theorem for differences of population proportions says that the sampling distribution for the differences follows a normal distribution as $n$ gets large:

$$ \hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2} \sim N \left(p_1 - p_2, \sqrt{ \frac{p_1\cdot(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2\cdot(1-p_2)}{n_2} } \right)$$

To use the CTL for differences of sample means you need:

+ independence: populations need to be randomly assigned to groups or randomly sampled from their populations.
+ success-failure: both populations need to meet the success-failure condition


#### **Example:** Consider an experiment for patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours. The results of the experiment is that $11$ patients out of a total of $50$ survived in the control group and $14$ patients out of a total of $40$ survived in the treatment group. Create a $90 \%$ confidence interval for the true difference in population proportions.

```{r}
# Independence: both samples were randomly divided

# Success-Failure
# control group
11/50*50 
(1-(11/50))*50
#treatment group
14/40*40 
(1-(14/40))*40

# since all the numbers are bigger than 10, the success-failure condition is met.

# known values

p_1 <- 11/50
n_1 <- 50

p_2 <- 14/40
n_2 <- 40

sample_difference <- p_1 - p_2

se <- sqrt(p_1*(1-p_1)/n_1 + p_2*(1-p_2)/n_2)

# critical z-scores
qnorm(.05)
qnorm(.95)

# confidence interval

sample_difference + qnorm(.05)*se
sample_difference + qnorm(.95)*se

# We are 90% confident that the true difference between the population proportions is between -28.7 and 2.7 percent. 

# Within the context of the problem, we are 90% confident that patients that do not take blood thinners survive at a rate between 28.7% less and 2.7% more than those that don't take blood thinners


```

#### **Problem:** A 5-year experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of fish oils on reducing cardiovascular events, where each subject was randomized into one of two treatment groups. Weâ€™ll consider heart attack outcomes in these patients: $145$ out of $12933$ patients taking fish oil had a heart attack and $200$ out of $13132$ patients taking a placebo had a heart attack.

## Mixed Practice

26. According to a report on sleep deprivation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the proportion of California residents who reported insufficient rest or sleep during each of the preceding $30$ days is $8.0 \%$, while this proportion is $8.8 \%$ for Oregon residents. These data are based on simple random samples of $11,545$ California and $4,691$ Oregon residents. Calculate a $95 \%$ confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of Californians and Oregonians who are sleep deprived and interpret it in context of the data, or explain why our methods do not apply.
